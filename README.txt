# üîç Sales Prediction and Visualization Using R Shiny on Bank Dataset

This project leverages the power of R Shiny to analyze, visualize, and predict bank sales performance using a synthetic dataset mimicking over a million transactions. The application supports interactive dashboards and machine learning-based predictions.

The tool includes insightful visualizations, a linear regression model for predictive sales analysis, and a forecasting module using ARIMA. With real-time data interactivity, the dashboard enables users to explore trends and derive actionable insights from transaction values across multiple cities and domains. The predictive system responds dynamically to both user input and randomly selected data entries, showcasing its practical flexibility in real-world scenarios.
